# Fong4Life Blood Donation Notifications

At RHoK Gambia June 2013 hackathon, Balafong Causes submitted this problem for the participants to work on. Two separate
teams submitted projects at the end of the event. This project aims to be the final version that will be deployed while
at the same time incorporating as much as possible from the two submitted projects which were both written in PHP.

Our hope is that this will eventually turn into a tool that any organization that does blood drives or similar
can easily download,  customize and deploy with little effort.
