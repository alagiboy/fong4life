# Fong4Life Blood Donation Notifications

At [RHoK Gambia June 2013](http://www.rhok.org/event/rhok-gambia-june-2013 "RHoK Gambia - June 2013"),
[Balafong](http://www.balafong.com "Balafong Website") Causes submitted
[this problem](http://www.rhok.org/node/107443 "Fong4life RHoK Problem Definition")
for the participants to work on. Two separate teams submitted projects at the end of the event.
This project aims to be the final version that will be deployed while at the same time incorporating as
much as possible from the two submitted projects which were both written in PHP.

Our hope is that this will eventually turn into a tool that any organization that does blood drives or similar
can easily download,  customize and deploy with minimal effort.
