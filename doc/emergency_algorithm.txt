How we notify
- After the pool of potential donors is identified, we

  - if no donor found after y minutes, admin can hit Send again to notify the next x donors

How Admin stops futher notifications
- "Donor Found" button
  - Pops up form where details about the donor is entered
  - stop any process that's still notifying potential donors
  - disable emergency so it can't be used for further notifications
  - notify previously contacted potential donors from S that a match has been found
